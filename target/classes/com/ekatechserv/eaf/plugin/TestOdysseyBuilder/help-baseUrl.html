    <i>Application Under Test (AUT) Base URL</i>. 
    In <B>Test-Odyssey</B>, <i>AUT URL</i> is stored in two parts - <i>Base URL</i> and <i>Fragment URL</i>.
    Base URL changes from <i>Development</i> to <i>Stage</i> to <i>UAT</i> environment. 
    In Test-Odyssey recording is done once and can be run in any environment by providing its base URL.
    Fragment URL is recorded in the datasets of the test-case. It doesn't change between Environments. 
    It is specific to the functionality the test-case intends to test.
    Example : 
    <tt>http://www.example.com/myModule.do</tt><BR>
    Here Base URL : <tt>http://www.example.com</tt> and Fragment URL will be <tt>/myModule</tt> which will be stored as part of the test-case.
